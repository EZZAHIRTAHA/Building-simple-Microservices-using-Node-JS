# Microservices Project

This is a simple microservices project built using Node.js. The project consists of multiple microservices that communicate with each other to perform various tasks. Each microservice is responsible for a specific functionality, allowing for a modular and scalable architecture.

The project demonstrates the use of RESTful APIs and asynchronous communication between microservices. It showcases how to handle inter-service communication, data sharing, and coordination in a distributed system.

Feel free to explore the project and learn about the concepts of microservices architecture and their implementation using Node.js.
